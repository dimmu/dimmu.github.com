### About
<br/>

I'm a machine learning researcher with more than 15 years of experience in the broader field. I completed my EngD on using machine learning methods for biomarker discovery under the supervision of Professors [**John Shawe-Taylor**](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/){:target="blank"} and Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes at UCL. I've spend a large part of my professional life on proteomics, biomarker discovery and the broader field of medicine.  In addition to the biomedicinal domain, my professional experience spans a number of settings including security, privacy-preserving machine learning, and finance. You might find some of my [**research**](#/features/02-publications) interesting,  or perhaps you'd like to have a look at my CV.
