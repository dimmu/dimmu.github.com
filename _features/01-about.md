### About
<br/>

I'm a machine learning researcher with more than 15 years of experience in the broader field. I completed my EngD under the supervision of Professors [**John Shawe-Taylor**](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/){:target="blank"} and Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes and I've published in the domains of computational biology, medicine, and privacy-preserving machine learning. My professional experience spans a number of settings including security, biotechnology, and finance. You might find some of my [**research**](#/features/02-publications) interesting,  or perhaps you'd like to have a look at my CV.
