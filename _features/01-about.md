### About
<br/>
I'm a machine learning researcher with more than 15 years of experience in the broader field. I completed my EngD on using machine learning methods for biomarker discovery under the supervision of Professors [**John Shawe-Taylor**](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/){:target="blank"} and Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes at UCL. In addition to the biomedical domain, my professional experience spans a number of settings including security, privacy-preserving machine learning, and finance. I work at [**Quine**](https://quine.sh/){:target="blank"} where I am building machine learning systems that leverage large scale natural language processing, with a healthy dose of graph processing. Prior to joining Quine, I was a machine learning researcher at Brave, where I worked on a machine learning model for in-browser privacy preserving ad recommendations, which has been responsible for serving ad recommendations to a few millions of users. In the past I have built machine learning systems for microscopy, bond markets, privacy preserving data mining, network security, malware detection, and brain imaging. My interests include numerical computing, machine learning, health & biomedicine, natural language processing, and making GPUs overheat, a habbit for which I occasionally get [**published**](#/features/02-publications) in peer-reviewed venues.
