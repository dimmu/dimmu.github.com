<p>On June 11, 2013 the Greek government issued a decision that abolished ERT, the Greek state-owned public radio and television broadcasting corporation. According to the decision, ERT was supposed to cease operations immediately and be succeeded by a new corporation. Instead, ERT&#8217;s 2,656 former employes protested the government&#8217;s decision and continued broadcasting by whatever means available (including satelite wildfeed, and internet broadcasting). How the former employees, handled themselves, while the government spokesman responsible for its dissolution was citing them as a have of waste and nepotism is very interesting.</p>

<p>It is somewhat ironic, that ERT only became relevant to me through its dissolution. I really don&#8217;t watch tv, and that&#8217;s even more the case for Greek state-run media. Given that ERT, averaged about 13% viewership broken between three different stations, I probably wasn&#8217;t the only one not paying attention. To some, this may speak about the perceived relevance of the organization. It does not however help in anticipating the people&#8217;s reaction to ERT&#8217;s closure. So, as someone with minimal interest in this situation, do I have anything to offer to the dialogue? When people go to extremes so as to discredit any views oposing their own is the norm, it might help to make a careful examination of everybody&#8217;s actions, reactions, and talking points.</p>

<h3 id='debacle_starts'>Debacle Starts</h3>

<p>Prior to the start of the debacle, ERT&#8217;s behavior was more or less in line with every heavily unionised greek public sector organization. At this point I must state that when a news organization goes on strike and nobody&#8217;s there to cover it, it becomes an interesting exercise in irony, but then again I have some interesting takes on such matters. The broadcaster&#8217;s closure, came as a bit of a shock. The current government used a recent legal provision, which effectively permits it to enact a law prior to discussion in parliament as an emergency measure in &#8216;extraordinary&#8217; times(although such decisions will have to be ratified at a later parliamentary session). The major party executed this move, without any regard for the opinions of its coalition partners - one party has already left the coalition after viewing this as the last straw. Branches of government they tell me are supposed to be transparent, and distinct - well bravo for greek democracy in action.</p>

<p>While the coalition government is busy executing its stratagem, I actually got curious enough to look for ERT internet feeds. There was a lot of televised angry rhetoric. People who up until a few hours ago were supposed to be objective reporters, presenting a fair and balanced view of the news, openly calling out the government fascists, nazis, petty dictators and other cute synonyms. While I can see part of their point, and definitely understand their pain, I think that waiting for all of this to happen in order to post-hoc go and call out the injusticies and indemnities all around you, even when emotionally charged is not a vote of confidence for your objectivity. Hell, when there is <em>an actual neo-nazi party in parliament</em>, I think this use of language is destructive.</p>

<p>With that, news started becoming into news, and then more news. Former employees, went on the air to name names on perceived scandals, and indemnities from their carreers in ert. Journalists going on the record, stating that they never understood that this was an option - that the option to negotiate pay cuts or voluntary leave was never offered. Soon, Tsipras, our beloved opposition leader jumped in the self-referential news masturbation bandwagon, which at times seemed capable of blinding ERT.</p>

<ul>
<li>The government <em>capitalised on the news</em>, seeing that as a kind of Thatcher moment.</li>

<li>The opposition <em>capitalised on the news</em>, seeing this as an example of government&#8217;s failure to comply to democratic checks and balances.</li>

<li>ERT, <em>capitalised on the news</em>, becoming relevant in Greek public discourse after a long, long time.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the question is now, what are the arguments for, or against ERT. A lot of what follows has been repeated, chewed over/regurgitated/remolded over the last few days. I have read so many things with so many different details by so many different news organizations, that some things are hard to differentiate from hearsay. You may want to take them with a grain of salt and do your own fact checking.</p>

<ul>
<li>Spending</li>

<li>nepotism</li>
</ul>

<p>Although I am often told by such folk that one needs professional journalists in order to discuss any news in depth, I thought I&#8217;d risk voiding the manufacturer&#8217;s guarantee on my brain and do it myself.</p>

<p>Το πιο αστείο από όλα είναι η φαντασίωση ότι η κυβέρνηση έχει σκοπό τον εξορθολογισμό του Δημοσίου.</p>

<p>Η απόφαση αυτή είναι δυστυχώς επώδυνη για τους εργαζόμενους στην ΕΡΤ που χάνουν τις δουλειές τους, εξαιτίας της πολιτικής όλων ανεξαιρέτως των μέχρι σήμερα κυβερνήσεων και των κρατικοδίαιτων συνδικαλιστών που τώρα διαμαρτύρονται. Η ΕΡΤ απασχολεί και σημαντικό αριθμό αξιόλογου προσωπικού, το οποίο απολύεται, τη στιγμή που εξακολουθούν να μισθοδοτούνται από το δημόσιο χιλιάδες επίορκοι υπάλληλοι.</p>

<p>So this leads us, ultimately, to what we all seem to agree on: if you must have a public broadcaster (and I don&#8217;t believe we must), then it needs independence in order to work.</p>

<p>Perceived crises give rise to perceived heroes. Then they try to capitalise on their perceived value. And we increment the douchebag counter</p>
